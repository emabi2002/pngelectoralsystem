## üìä Statistical Analysis Guide

### Demographic Indicators

#### 1. Dependency Ratio
**Formula**: ((Population 0-14 + Population 65+) √∑ Population 15-64) √ó 100

**Interpretation**:
- <50: Low dependency, large working-age population
- 50-75: Moderate dependency
- >75: High dependency, strain on working-age population

#### 2. Age-Sex Pyramid Analysis
**Method**: Create stacked bar chart (males left, females right) by age group

**Patterns to Identify**:
- **Pyramid**: Young, growing population
- **Bell**: Mature, stable population
- **Inverted Pyramid**: Aging population
- **Irregular**: Migration, conflict, or data quality issues

#### 3. Sex Ratio
**Formula**: (Male Population √∑ Female Population) √ó 100

**Normal Range**: 95-105

**Deviations**:
- <95: Female majority (migration, conflict mortality)
- >105: Male majority (labor migration, data issues)

---

### Disability Indicators

#### 1. Overall Disability Prevalence
**Formula**: (Persons with disability √∑ Total population) √ó 100

**Global Average**: 15% (WHO estimate)

**PNG Context**: Compare to national baseline and regional data

#### 2. Prevalence by Domain
**Formula**: (Persons with "A lot of difficulty" or "Cannot do at all" in domain √∑ Total population) √ó 100

**Most Common Globally**:
1. Mobility (walking)
2. Vision (seeing)
3. Cognition (remembering)
