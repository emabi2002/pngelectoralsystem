## üóÑÔ∏è Database Management

### Database Schema

**Tables**:
- `households`: Household census data
- `population`: Individual person records
- `citizens`: PNG NID citizen data
- `voters`: Electoral roll
- `polling_results`: Election results
- `audit_logs`: System audit trail
- `user_profiles`: User accounts

### Schema Updates

**Always backup before schema changes!**

```sql
-- Example: Adding a new field
ALTER TABLE households
ADD COLUMN new_field_name TEXT;

-- Create index for performance
CREATE INDEX idx_new_field ON households(new_field_name);
```

### Data Integrity Checks

```sql
-- Check for orphaned population records (no household)
SELECT p.id, p.full_name, p.household_id
FROM population p
LEFT JOIN households h ON p.household_id = h.id
WHERE h.id IS NULL;

-- Check for households with no members
SELECT h.id, h.household_number, h.total_members
FROM households h
LEFT JOIN population p ON h.id = p.household_id
WHERE p.id IS NULL
  AND h.total_members > 0;

-- Verify disability flag consistency
SELECT id, full_name, has_disability,
       difficulty_seeing, difficulty_hearing, difficulty_walking,
       difficulty_remembering, difficulty_selfcare, difficulty_communicating
FROM population
WHERE has_disability = false
  AND (
    difficulty_seeing IN ('A lot of difficulty', 'Cannot do at all')
    OR difficulty_hearing IN ('A lot of difficulty', 'Cannot do at all')
    OR difficulty_walking IN ('A lot of difficulty', 'Cannot do at all')
    OR difficulty_remembering IN ('A lot of difficulty', 'Cannot do at all')
    OR difficulty_selfcare IN ('A lot of difficulty', 'Cannot do at all')
    OR difficulty_communicating IN ('A lot of difficulty', 'Cannot do at all')
  );
```

## üîí Security & Access Control

### Row Level Security (RLS) Policies

**Status**: Enabled on all tables

**Key Policies**:
- Users can only view their own profile
- Enumerators can only view/edit data in their EA
- Supervisors can view/edit data in their province
- Analysts can view all data (read-only)
- Administrators have full access

### Reviewing RLS Policies

```sql
SELECT schemaname, tablename, policyname, roles, qual, with_check
FROM pg_policies
WHERE schemaname = 'public';
```

### Audit Trail

All data modifications are logged in `audit_logs`:

```sql
SELECT
  al.created_at,
  up.full_name as user_name,
  al.action,
  al.table_name,
  al.record_id,
  al.new_values
FROM audit_logs al
JOIN user_profiles up ON al.user_id = up.id
ORDER BY al.created_at DESC
LIMIT 100;
```

## üìä System Monitoring

### Performance Metrics

**Database Performance**:
```sql
-- Slow queries
SELECT query, mean_exec_time, calls
FROM pg_stat_statements
WHERE mean_exec_time > 1000 -- queries taking >1 second
ORDER BY mean_exec_time DESC
LIMIT 20;

-- Table sizes
SELECT
  tablename,
  pg_size_pretty(pg_total_relation_size(schemaname||'.'||tablename)) AS size
FROM pg_tables
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
ORDER BY pg_total_relation_size(schemaname||'.'||tablename) DESC;

-- Active connections
SELECT count(*) as connection_count
FROM pg_stat_activity;
```

**Application Health**:
- Monitor: Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí Metrics
- Check: CPU usage, Memory, Database connections
- Alert: Set up alerts for >80% utilization

### Usage Statistics

```sql
-- User activity
SELECT
  DATE(created_at) as date,
  COUNT(*) as logins
FROM user_profiles
WHERE last_login IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY DATE(created_at)
ORDER BY date DESC;

-- Registration activity
SELECT
  DATE(created_at) as date,
  COUNT(*) as households_registered
FROM households
GROUP BY DATE(created_at)
ORDER BY date DESC;

-- Population enumeration
SELECT
  DATE(enumeration_date) as date,
  COUNT(*) as individuals_registered
FROM population
GROUP BY DATE(enumeration_date)
ORDER BY date DESC;
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Issue: Users can't log in
**Diagnostics**:
```sql
-- Check user exists
SELECT * FROM auth.users WHERE email = 'user@example.pg';

-- Check profile exists
SELECT * FROM user_profiles WHERE email = 'user@example.pg';

-- Check account active
SELECT is_active FROM user_profiles WHERE email = 'user@example.pg';
```

**Solutions**:
- Verify email confirmed
- Check is_active = true
- Reset password if needed
- Verify RLS policies not blocking

#### Issue: Slow dashboard performance
**Diagnostics**:
- Check database query performance (see monitoring section)
- Review browser console for errors
- Check network tab for slow API calls

**Solutions**:
- Add database indexes on frequently queried fields
- Implement pagination for large datasets
- Enable caching where appropriate
- Optimize complex queries

#### Issue: Data sync failures
**Diagnostics**:
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify internet connection
- Check Supabase status page

**Solutions**:
- Retry sync manually
- Check for database locks
- Verify user permissions
- Clear browser cache and retry
