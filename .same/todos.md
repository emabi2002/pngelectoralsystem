# PNG Digital Electoral System - Production Readiness

**Current Tasks (Oct 12, 2025)**
- [x] Hide AppShell chrome on /login to show a clean login screen
- [x] Display friendly message when account is inactive or profile missing
- [x] Support redirect back to originally requested route after successful login
- [ ] Validate all four demo accounts can sign in and land on role dashboards
- [ ] If any account shows "account_inactive", ensure corresponding row exists in `user_profiles` with `is_active = true`

## 🔑 Supabase Anon Key Configured
- NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL set to https://usipijjyqfpxmhjbebyo.supabase.co
- NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY updated and present in .env.local

## 🚨 LATEST UPDATE: Build Error Fixed! ✅

### Fix #2 - Missing Import Error (Oct 11, 2025) ✅ RESOLVED
**Problem**: Registration page showing "ERR_FAILED" - site unreachable
- User clicked "Start Registration" → got error page
- Root cause: Build error preventing all pages from being generated
- Error: `ReferenceError: TrendingUp is not defined` in census page

**Solution Applied**:
- ✅ Added missing `TrendingUp` import to `src/app/census/page.tsx`
- ✅ Build now completes successfully (verified locally)
- ✅ All 14 routes now generate correctly including `/register`
- ✅ Committed to GitHub: commit `f5a1350`
- ✅ Pushed successfully

**What's Fixed**:
- ✅ Registration page (`/register`) - now works
- ✅ Census page (`/census`) - build error fixed
- ✅ All other routes - properly generated
- ✅ Netlify deployment - ready to auto-deploy

**Next**: Waiting for Netlify auto-deployment (3-5 minutes)

### Fix #1 - Netlify Dependency Error (Oct 11, 2025) ✅ RESOLVED
**Problem**: Netlify deployment failed with dependency resolution error
- Error: `@radix-ui/react-progress@^1.3.3` version not found
