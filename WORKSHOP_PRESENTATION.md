## Slide 14: Discussion - Real-World Scenarios

### **How Would You Handle These Situations?**

**Scenario 1**: Enumerator in remote area with no connectivity for 3 days
- **Solution**: Offline functionality, sync when back to coverage

**Scenario 2**: Person refuses to answer disability questions
- **Solution**: Mark as "No difficulty" if they can demonstrate function, or "Prefer not to answer" option

**Scenario 3**: Household members temporarily away (migrant workers)
- **Solution**: Register usual residents, note migration status

**Scenario 4**: Person with disability cannot take photo (sensitivity)
- **Solution**: Biometrics optional, can skip if consent not given

**Scenario 5**: Supervisor notices many errors from one enumerator
- **Solution**: Low quality alert triggers, supervisor contacts for retraining

**Discussion**: What other scenarios should we consider?

## Slide 17: Disability Data - Washington Group Standards

### **Why Washington Group Questions?**

**Global Standard**: Used in 100+ countries

**Functional Approach**: Measures difficulty in doing, not medical diagnosis

**6 Core Domains**:
1. **Seeing**: Even with glasses
2. **Hearing**: Even with hearing aid
3. **Walking**: Or climbing steps
4. **Remembering**: Or concentrating
5. **Self-care**: Washing or dressing
6. **Communicating**: Understanding or being understood

**4 Response Categories**:
- No difficulty
- Some difficulty
- A lot of difficulty ‚Üê **Disability threshold**
- Cannot do at all ‚Üê **Disability threshold**

**Disability Identification**: Person has difficulty in ANY domain = has disability

**Why This Matters**:
- Identifies 10-20% of population (vs 2-3% with medical approach)
- Enables targeted support services
- Aligns with UN Convention on Rights of Persons with Disabilities
- Comparable across countries for SDG monitoring
